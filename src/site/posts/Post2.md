Perhaps it is a bit presumptuous of me, but I wanted to start this page with a quick descruption of where I am in my flight training, and how I got here. This may be a multi-part story.

Imagine, if you will, that you just turned 30. At the top of your game, you are basically where you dreamed you would be as a child. Very good at what you do, you are known for your ability to have the right answer, and for being smart enough to know when you don't know. On the cusp of meeting the income goal you set as a teenager (six figueres, right?), you have few goals left unaccomlished from your childhood. One stands out, though. Flight. Still, flight school is expensive, and while you make quite a bit of money, you have quite a bit of debt from your 20's. Between the divorce, the failed relationships, and the job hopping to get ahead, you find that you have precious little liquid money, and most of what you get, you throw at bills acrued while climbing the ladder. 

Still, it could be worse. Much, much worse. You just need to get ahead of the debt, and all will be well. 

Your company sends you to VM World, and you sit through hours of seminars. Some good. Some not so good. And you randomly put your business card in a box, just to get some mints. You land, and this happens:

And your world changes, just a little bit.
