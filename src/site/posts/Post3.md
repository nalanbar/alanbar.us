And so after the tweet by Simplivity, I went home, changed, and went to bed. I mentioned it to my Caitlin, and she said, and this is a quote, "Ok." 

Of course, neither of us knew what it meant to win a super car. I emailed Simplivity the next day, and was told that I had, indeed, won the McLaren, and that I had some paper work to do.

They explained that I won a one year lease of a McLaren 650s (in a beautiful graphite color), and the cost of that least was $50,000. I also had an option for a $20,000 lump sum in leu of the car. Being a car guy, it was a really hard choice. 

A hard choice that was made easier when I remembered that I was living in an apartment, with street parking, on a hill, in a heavily trafficked portion of Burlington. And winter was coming. 

### I chose the cash

I chose the cash. Didn't really have a choice, in the end. The insurance was just too expensive if I took the McLaren, and didn't cover enough miles for me to even drive it to work twice a week. 

If you have won a large sum of money before, this won't come as a surprise to you, but I will assume most of you have not. Here is how it is handled:

They give you a 1099MISC, and you add it to your income as though they paid you for a big job. Your income just went from 80k to 100k a year. 

So... what does that do to your taxes?

Well, if you are a normal American, playing the witholding game every paycheck, juggling you allowances, the answer to that question is "breaks them." You jump immediately from maybe getting a small tax refund (on your interest free loan to the Feds) to having to pay in. Figure something like 25% when all is said and done. Sure, you just got an extra $20,000, but you have to pay in $5,000, and nobody tells you how the process works. I am glad I asked before I started spending, because
I could have really screwed myself.
