And so after the tweet by Simplivity, I went home, changed, and went to bed. I mentioned it to my Caitlin, and she said, and this is a quote, "Ok." 

Of course, neither of us knew what it meant to win a super car. I emailed Simplivity the next day, and was told that I had, indeed, won the McLaren, and that I had some paper work to do.

They explained that I won a one year lease of a McLaren 650s (in a beautiful graphite color), and the cost of that least was $50,000. I also had an option for a $20,000 lump sum in leu of the car. Being a car guy, it was a really hard choice.
