Yesterday was the big (or at least, not small) day. My triumphant return to flying. I finished all of the administrative/preperatory junk (the medical, restablishing basic medical care after a decade of not seeing a doctor, quiting smoking [more on _THAT_ to follow!], clearing up my credit card balance issues) it was finally time to fly again. 

I had this weird issue where I never want to seem over-prepared or underpredared, so I spent days AGONIZING over what gear to take with me. I spent at least a week testing my electronics to make sure everything worked, and everything had a backup, I agonized over foreflight vs garmin pilot, I fought what I thought at the time was the flu (but actually turned out to be an alergic reaction to a tetanus vaccination), I charged my Pilot-USA PA-1779T, I checked the weather, I read the Weather Underground ten day forecast, then the TAF, then the METAR, I made sure I had all of the weight and balance done days in advance, bought some Maui Jim Lava Tube sunglasses in my prescription (with the Sunrise Pink  mirror lenses), went to bed early the night before, woke up early and anxious the morning of, grabbed a coffee and a breakfast sandwich, and headed to the airport. 

I met my new instructor (whose permission I do not yet have to name on this blog, so I will refer to her as V), briefed on our flight plan, and met my new buddy, N9698V. 

98V is a 1975 Cessna 172N, with long range tanks, a GTN650, and a very nice yellow paint job. The interior is only OK, but 98V is more about substance than style.

V made sure I remembered how to preflight a 172 (surprise, not all of it!) and then we pulled it out of the hangar, got it started, and taxied out. 

Here was the METAR for my takeoff yesterday:

> KBTV 210954Z AUTO 00000KT 10SM CLR M16/M18 A3065 RMK AO2 SLP387 T11561183

Field altitude is about 320 MSL, so my density altitude was about 42000 _below sea level._ This is not something that I am used to, and the 172N has more power than the 172M I flew previously, in autumn, out of a grass field. 

To say that 98V's climb out was brisk was an understatement. It _scared me_ how fast we climbed; I was expecting a Cessna 172, not a rocketship. I climbed out at 1400 FPM, but chickened out pretty quickly. I actually tried to hand the airplane back to V, but she didn't hear me (or is a really good instructor, and new that I was just being a nervous nelly) and never responded "I have the plane," so I continued to fly.

We flew to the north, and
